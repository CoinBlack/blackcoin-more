/** A formatter for a bespoke serialization for acyclic DepGraph objects.
 *
 * The serialization format outputs information about transactions in a topological order (parents
 * before children), together with position information so transactions can be moved back to their
 * correct position on deserialization.
 *
 * - For each transaction t in the DepGraph (in some topological order);
 *   - The size: VARINT(t.size), which cannot be 0.
 *   - The fee: VARINT(SignedToUnsigned(t.fee)), see below for SignedToUnsigned.
 *   - For each direct dependency:
 *     - VARINT(skip)
 *   - The position of t in the cluster: VARINT(skip)
 * - The end of the graph: VARINT(0)
 *
 * The list of skip values encodes the dependencies of t, as well as its position in the cluster.
 * Each skip value is the number of possibilities that were available, but were not taken. These
 * possibilities are, in order:
 * - For each previous transaction in the graph, in reverse serialization order, whether it is a
 *   direct parent of t (but excluding transactions which are already implied to be dependencies
 *   by parent relations that were serialized before it).
 * - The various insertion positions in the cluster, from the very end of the cluster, to the
 *   front.
 *
 * Let's say you have a 7-transaction cluster, consisting of transactions F,A,C,B,G,E,D, but
 * serialized in order A,B,C,D,E,F,G, because that happens to be a topological ordering. By the
 * time G gets serialized, what has been serialized already represents the cluster F,A,C,B,E,D (in
 * that order). G has B and E as direct parents, and E depends on C.
 *
 * In this case, the possibilities are, in order:
 * - [ ] the dependency G->F
 * - [X] the dependency G->E
 * - [ ] the dependency G->D
 * - [X] the dependency G->B
 * - [ ] the dependency G->A
 * - [ ] put G at the end of the cluster
 * - [ ] put G before D
 * - [X] put G before E
 * - [ ] put G before B
 * - [ ] put G before C
 * - [ ] put G before A
 * - [ ] put G before F
 *
 * The skip values in this case are 1 (G->F), 1 (G->D), 3 (G->A, G at end, G before D). No skip
 * after 3 is needed (or permitted), because there can only be one position for G. Also note that
 * G->C is not included in the list of possibilities, as it is implied by the included G->E and
 * E->C that came before it. On deserialization, if the last skip value was 8 or larger (putting
 * G before the beginning of the cluster), it is interpreted as wrapping around back to the end.
 *
 *
 * Rationale:
 * - Why VARINTs? They are flexible enough to represent large numbers where needed, but more
 *   compact for smaller numbers. The serialization format is designed so that simple structures
 *   involve smaller numbers, so smaller size maps to simpler graphs.
 * - Why use SignedToUnsigned? It results in small unsigned values for signed values with small
 *   absolute value. This way we can encode negative fees in graphs, but still let small negative
 *   numbers have small encodings.
 * - Why are the parents emitted in reverse order compared to the transactions themselves? This
 *   naturally lets us skip parents-of-parents, as they will be reflected as implied dependencies.
 * - Why encode skip values and not a bitmask to convey the list positions? It turns out that the
 *   most complex graphs (in terms of linearization complexity) are ones with ~1 dependency per
 *   transaction. The current encoding uses ~1 byte per transaction for dependencies in this case,
 *   while a bitmask would require ~N/2 bits per transaction.
