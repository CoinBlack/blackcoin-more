Blackcoin More
=============

Setup
---------------------
Blackcoin More is a Blackcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Blackcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Blackcoin More, visit [blackcoinmore.org](https://blackcoinmore.org).
